          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p class="mission">Charged with designing a simplistic way of finding sustainable food choices that supoort the community, our team of both new and seasoned Lambda students set to work, exercising their skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and good eating to bring you this app! Our new web developers who built our pages were Ramona Lucius, Ryan Mersmann, and Aaron Mendez, hoping to use their skills to present our idea to you! Joshua Humphrey, Jane Suh, Adella K, and Jacob VanWormer were the ones who worked together to build our app, putting together the pieces of this puzzle. Our wizard behind the curtain, Charlie Montoya, was the back-end developer, who made everything work! Guiding this rag-tag group was Amanda Lane, who patiently worked with us to help us make this all reality! Please use this site to get more involved into your community, and to improve your health through good clean eating. Enjoy!</p>
